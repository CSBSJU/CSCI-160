    <h2>
      Sets and Maps&#8212;Steno Pools and Inventories
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will use two sets to keep track of which workers are busy
      and which are idle; you'll also write a program that maintains a small
      inventory.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab15</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab15</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: #d33682;">
    Lab15
    |-- Inventory.java
    |-- Lab.html
    |-- Part.class
    |-- parts.txt
    |-- solution
    |    |-- Inventory.class
    |    |-- Part.class

    <h3>
      Part 1: Keeping track of who's busy and who's idle in the steno pool
    </h3>

    <p>
      In the old days, there were no personal computers, no iPods, no
      Dictaphones (and no Internet, but that's not relevant here). If a business
      person wanted to create a document, such as sending a letter, they
      wouldn't create it themselves&mdash;oh no!&mdash;they would use a
      stenographer. A stenographer took dictation using shorthand and then
      transcribed the shorthand into a document using a typewriter. In a large
      company, business people who weren't important enough to have their own
      personal secretary would request someone from the <em>steno pool</em>, a
      group of stenographers who were available to take dictation and type
      documents for the business people. Ask your grandparents if you want to
      know more, or just watch <em>Mad Men</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your job is to write a program that manages a steno pool. The pool should
      be implemented using two sets, one for the available stenographers and one
      for those stenographers currently taking dictation. Just use names
      (<code>String</code>s) for the stenographers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The program will handle several operations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        add stenographers to the available set
      </li>
      <li>
        remove them from the available set
      </li>
      <li>
        list the stenographers in each set separately
      </li>
      <li>
        move them between the two sets
      </li>
      <li>
        quit the program.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Show your work to the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Keeping track of inventory
    </h3>

    <p>
      In this part, you will write a program that manages an inventory list. You
      should use the command interpreter from the previous exercise as a model.
      Each inventory item, represented by the opaque class <code>Part</code>,
      will have an <code>int</code> part number, a <code>String</code> name and
      an <code>int</code> number of items of this part in stock.
    </p>

    <p>
      The class <code>Part</code> has the following methods defined:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Part(int partNumber, String partName);</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>int getPartNumber();</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>int getPartInStock();</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>String getPartName();</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>void setPartInStock(int);</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>String toString();</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This program will use one map for the part number, part name, and stock.
      It will be of type <em>Map&lt;Integer, Part&gt;</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program will handle several operations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Add new inventory items with an initial stock of 0. Report to the user
        if the item couldn't be added because the part number is already in use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Look up an inventory item by part number and report the part name and
        stock.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove an inventory item by part number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add stock for an inventory item. Be sure not to add stock to an item
        that isn't already in the map.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove stock for an inventory item, but not more than the stock on hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Display the entire inventory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the inventory to a file, one record per line, in the format: part
        number&lt;newline&gt;part name&lt;newline&gt;stock
      </li>
      <li>
        Load a new inventory from a file in the same format. (Done for you)
      </li>
      <li>
        Quit the program.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you have finished, show your work to the TA or lab instructor.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 3: Extra credit
    </h3>

    <p>
      Implement the <code>Part</code> class for yourself, i.e., delete the
      <kbd>Part.class</kbd> file that was distributed with the lab. Then
      correctly implement the methods described above to get your program
      working as it was after finishing Part 2. Remember, you can always go back
      to the <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs/Lab15</kbd> directory to get a
      fresh copy of <kbd>Part.class</kbd> if you need to debug.
