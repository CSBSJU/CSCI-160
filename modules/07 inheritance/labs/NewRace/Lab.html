          All comments set off with &#8220;***&#8221; are instructions to you as

    <h3>
      Part 1: Animating the turtle and the hare
    </h3>

    <p>
      In this part of the lab we're going to redo the turtle and hare race so
      you don't have to continually click the mouse to run the race. We will use
      a simple inheritance hierarchy to accomplish this. At the top of our
      hierarchy, we will have a class, <code>Racer</code>. This class will
      implement the functionality required for a racer to run the race
      autonomously once they are started. The <code>TurtleRacer</code> and
      <code>HareRacer</code> classes will be sub-classes of the
      <code>Racer</code> class, which means that they will inherit this
      functionality.

      The <code>NewRace</code> class will create the racer objects, put them on
      the race course, and start them. Each racer will time themselves (fairly!)
      and report their times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make two new Java files <kbd>TurtleRacer.java</kbd> and
      <kbd>HareRacer.java</kbd>. Modify the files <kbd>TurtleRacer.java</kbd>
      and <kbd>HareRacer.java</kbd> so they implement the
      <code>TurtleRacer</code> and <code>HareRacer</code> classes, respectively;
      use your code from Lab 4 to make your classes draw the two animals. Each
      of these classes should be a sub-class of <code>Racer</code>, which is
      itself a sub-class of <code>GCompound</code>. This is helpful because it
      means that the <code>TurtleRacer</code> and <code>HareRacer</code> classes
      are also sub-classes of the <code>GCompound</code> class.

      Complete the <code>run()</code> method in the <code>Racer</code> class to
      give your racers the ability to autonomously complete the race and report
      their elapsed time.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Adding another racer
    </h3>

    <p>
      Make a class for a new animal (not a turtle or hare). Modify the
      <code>NewRace</code> class so that there are three racers, including one
      of the new animal.
    </p>

    <p>
      As usual, when you are done with the in-lab exercises above, have your lab
      instructor or TA check over your work before you leave the lab.
