**Learning outcomes** are designed to assess student mastery in a course.

## Coding style
### CSCI-160-CS-BR-1
**Objective:** Assess student's ability to consistently place curly braces '{'
'}' in Java code.  
**Justification:** Improves code readability.

### CSCI-160-CS-IN-1
**Objective:** Assess student's ability to correctly indent Java code.  
**Justification:** Rule #5 (The Elements of Java Style).

### CSCI-160-CS-JD-1
**Objective:** Assess student's understanding of JavaDoc comments. Students are
expected to provide JavaDoc style comments for all classes, methods, and fields.  
**Justification:** Rules #32, #53 (The Elements of Java Style).

### CSCI-160-CS-NC-1
**Objective:** Assess student's understanding of Java naming conventions.
Students are expected to use _PascalCase_ for classes and _camelCase_ for
methods and variables.  
**Justification:** Rules #22, #25 (The Elements of Java Style).

### CSCI-160-CS-NC-2
**Objective:** Assess student's understanding of advanced naming convention
topics. Currently considered is the use of _ALL\_CAPITAL_ letters, combined with
underscores, for constant values.  
**Justification:** Rule #31 (The Elements of Java Style).

### CSCI-160-CS-NC-3
**Objective:** Assess student's ability and willingness to identify meaningful
names for classes, methods, and variables.  
**Justification:** Rule #9 (The Elements of Java Style).

### CSCI-160-CS-VS-1
**Objective:** Assess student's understanding of variable scope. Students are
expected to minimize variable scope, i.e., declare variables only within the
scope in which they are required. The two scopes considered as part of this
outcome are _class-level_ and _method-level_.  
**Justification:** Minimizing variable scope makes it much easier for someone
looking at the code to identify the datatype for said variables. It can also be
helpful for determining the semantic value of the variable, i.e., what it is
used for. Conversely, declaring variables in scopes where the are not needed
pollutes the name space, i.e., reduces the potential set of variable identifiers
from which one can choose.

### CSCI-160-CS-VS-2
**Objective:** Assess student's understanding of advanced variable scope. This
objective considers _block-level_ scope in addition to those considered in
[CS160-CS-VS-1](#cs160-cs-vs-1).  
**Justification:** Same as [CSCI-160-CS-VS-1](#csci-160-cs-vs-1).
