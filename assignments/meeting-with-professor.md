## Scheduling meetings

CSB/SJU has made a decision to use the family of products known as Microsoft
Office. Among them is an application for sending/receiving email called
Microsoft Outlook. Besides email, Outlook is also capable of managing the
digital calendar associated with your CSB/SJU email account. One of the useful
functionalities that this provides is the ability to easily schedule meetings
with other users within the CSB/SJU network. Your task is to schedule a
10-minute meeting with me before the first exam (this is a real meeting that you
will be expected to come to, not just a fictitious one for the sake of this
assignment, so plan accordingly).
