    <h2>
      Lab 11: Manipulating Text&#8212;Pig Latin
    </h2>

    <p>
      Perhaps you remember trying to speak in “Pig Latin” as a child. Words
      starting with consonants (all of the consonants before the first vowel)
      have the starting consonants removed from the front of a word and added to
      the end of the word followed by “ay” so that, for example, “way” becomes
      “ayway”, “java” becomes “avajay”, “theme” becomes “emethay", and so on.
      Words starting with a vowel stay the same with a “way” appended to their
      end so that “elated” becomes “elatedway”, “after” becomes “afterway” etc.
      In particular, if you had “awesome Pig Latin” it would become “awesomeway
      igPay atinLay”. If you need to refresh your memory more on Pig Latin,
      check out this website:

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab11</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab11</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 1: A method that translates one word into Pig Latin
    </h3>

    <p>
      You will be completing a program that can take any string of zero or more
      English words and translate it to a string of equivalent words in Pig
      Latin. You have been given a complete main program,
      <code>GraphicsPigLatin</code>, that provides the user interface for the
      translater and a class, <code>PigLatinString</code>, that represents a
      string that can be translated from English to Pig Latin. The user
      interface uses Java GUI components that we haven't studied yet, but you
      won't need to work with those parts of the program. The
      <code>translate()</code> method in the <code>PigLatinString</code> class,
      completed for you, is responsible for translating a
      <code>PigLatinString</code> object from English to Pig Latin, but it
      relies on the unfinished <code>translateWord()</code> method. Your job is
      to complete the <code>translateWord()</code> method in the
      <code>PigLatinString</code> class. The rules for how the method should
      work are in the class comment at the top of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your work to the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Correcting the capitalization
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <code>translateWord()</code> method doesn't work correctly for words
      beginning with a capital consonant. Modify this method so that it handles
      this case correctly; for example, “Pig Latin” will become “Igpay Atinlay”
      instead of “igPay atinLay.” The <code>Character</code> and
      <code>String</code> classes should provide methods appropriate for
      accomplishing this task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your work to the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 3: Translating text files into Pig Latin
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a new program that opens a <code>Scanner</code> on a text file,
      reads and translates each line of the file to Pig Latin, and writes each
      translated line to another file using a <code>PrintWriter</code>. The
      paths for the files should be provided as command-line arguments, i.e.,
      the <code>args</code> array in the <code>main()</code> method. Study the
      <code>actionPerformed()</code> method in the <code>GraphicsPigLatin</code>
      class for example usage of the <code>PigLatinString</code> class and its
      <code>translate()</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the two text files provided in the lab directory, or create
      some of your own, to check your solution for correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your completed program to the TA or lab instructor.
