## Preface
The CSCI 160 Syllabus [^1] serves to set forth what is expected during the
semester from the instructor and the students and to guide the behaviors of both
parties. More specifically, this syllabus delineates the responsibilities of
students and of the instructor for various tasks, including attendance,
assignments, examinations, and other requirements [^2]. It also describes
appropriate procedures and course policies so that both students and the
instructor know ahead of time how certain potential occurrences&mdash;such as
missing an exam or submitting a late assignment&mdash;will be handled.

## Introduction
### Purpose
Programming is at the core of computer science. Although most of the work done by computer scientists is not programming per se, that work is almost always under-girded by a knowledge of programming. It is essential that both programmers and computer scientists learn to program and to do so well. This course will provide students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental concepts and techniques of object-oriented computer programming. The object-oriented programming paradigm promises to improve the quality and reliability of computer software. In this course we will use the Java language, which is currently the most popular object-oriented language. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
* write well-designed Java programs for small-scale problems,
* identify appropriate object classes for solving a given problem, and
* write good documentation for programs.

### Requirements
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC
2119 <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span></a>.

Students are REQUIRED to have access to the textbook, *Big Java: Early Objects*
by Cay Horstmann. This course is based on the sixth edition of the book, thus,
it is RECOMMENDED that students acquire this edition.

### Terminology
<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>class meeting</i></dt>
  <dd>A meeting scheduled during the time slot assigned to the course and during
      the university approved academic calendar for the relevant semester. Such
      meetings will normally take place in the assigned classroom, however, they
      MAY occur elsewhere.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>excused absence</i></dt>
  <dd>An absence from a scheduled class meeting with prior permission from the
      instructor. In the event that prior permission cannot be obtained, the
      student MUST notify the instructor of the reason for the absence as soon
      as reasonably possible. Reasons for missing a class meeting that qualify
      as excused include, but are not limited to, documented illness, death in
      your family, varsity athletic events (MUST NOT be practices), or other
      performances.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>unexcused absence</i></dt>
  <dd>An absence that is not excused.</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>original work</i></dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>closed book</i></dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:normal;"><i>open note</i></dt>
  <dd>...</dd>
</dl>

## Course policies
### Attendance
Attendance is REQUIRED at all class meetings. Each unexcused absence MAY result
in a 1% reduction in the final grade for the course. Students who have more than
three unexcused absences from either class or lab, MAY receive a failing grade
for the course. Habitual lateness in attending class meetings MAY be treated as
unexcused absence.

## Labs
There will be two scheduled 80-minute labs each week. Attendance at all labs is
REQUIRED. Unexcused lab absence MAY result in the loss of points for the missed
lab. In most cases, each lab will consist of prelab exercises to be completed
before the scheduled lab time and selected exercises to be completed during the
lab period.  
It is the responsibility of the student to demonstrate completion
of their prelab exercise to the TA or lab instructor at the beginning of the
scheduled lab. Students who complete the lab exercises during the lab period
will demonstrate their completion to the lab instructor or TA before leaving the
lab. Those in attendance who do not complete the exercises during the allotted
lab time will still earn full credit by showing their solutions to their lab
instructor or TA at the beginning of the next scheduled Tuesday lab (in effect,
lab exercises are due on the Tuesday following the lab).  
Leaving lab before the schedule 80 minutes without permission from the lab
instructor and without demonstrating completion of the lab exercises MAY result
in loss of points for those exercises not marked complete.

### Assignments
There will be several assignments during the semester including: readings,
in-class exercises, and take-home exercises. All of these assignments are
intended to be collaborative in nature and you are encouraged to work together
to understand the material and come up with solutions. However, all work
submitted for a grade MUST be your own original work. Late assignment
submissions MAY NOT be accepted.

### Examinations
There will be two closed book/open note in-class exams, seven closed book/closed
note in-class quizzes, three open book/open note in-lab exams, and one
cumulative final exam. Each student's lowest two in-class quiz grades will be
dropped. All quiz and exam times are documented on the <a
href="https://csbsju.instructure.com/calendar">Canvas calendar <span class="fas
fa-external-link-alt"></span></a> for this course; you are responsible for
keeping those times clear in your schedule. Students MAY be allowed to make up
missed exams in the case of an excused absence and at the discretion of the
instructor.

### Emails / Outlook meeting invitations
I welcome emails and Outlook meeting invitations from students. However, you
SHOULD use the following guidelines when sending either to me:
* start the subject line with CS160, CS 160, CSCI160, or CSCI 160
* provide a concise description in subject line
* use a salutation like, "Good afternoon Prof. Iverson" or just "Prof. Iverson"
* conclude your message with a signature like, "Sincerely, Jeremy" or even as
  simple as just "Jeremy", to indicate who the message is from
* use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar

If you fail to incorporate any of the above suggestions when corresponding with
me via email or meeting invitations, then I MAY NOT respond in a timely manner,
or for grievous infractions, at all.

### Evaluation
The final grade for the course will be based on the percentages shown below.

| Labs           | 15% |
| Lab exams      | 10% |
| Quizzes        | 10% |
| Assignments    | 20% |
| In-class exams | 30% |
| Final exam     | 15% |

Grading is mainly based on the performance of each student compared to the class
as a whole. In general, the following guidelines are followed expect in certain
situations where the instructor sees a need for adjustments. A grade of F MAY be
given in situations of frequent unexcused absences, unsuccessful completion of
required work in a timely manner, or evident lack of understanding of core
material as illustrated by exam scores (e.g., failing all exams MAY result in an
F grade regardless of your total final score).

| A  | &ge;94% |
| AB | &ge;87% |
| B  | &ge;84% |
| BC | &ge;77% |
| C  | &ge;74% |
| CD | &ge;67% |
| D  | &ge;64% |
| F  | &lt;64% |

## Special accommodations
Students needing special accommodations or who have special needs are invited to
share this information with the instructor as early as possible.

## Scholastic conduct
