title: "COVID-19 course plan"
---

In response to classes at CSB/SJU being moved online, the following plan is
articulated:

### Asynchronous content delivery
* Each week, a few short videos will be assigned to complement the assigned
  readings from the book.
  * Occasionally, there will be short assignments that are introduced in the
    videos that I offer as an opportunity for you all to deepen you
    understanding of the material. This would be similar in spirit to the
    problem that we had been doing during class meetings. These assignments will
    no be submitted for a grade, but I would be happy to go over your solutions
    in individual or small group meetings.
* Labs will be made available on Monday each week and will be due the Tuesday
  after they were assigned. That is, labs for all sections will be due by
  11:59:59 p.m. the following Tuesday [AOE][aoe].
* Lab quizzes will not be administered. Rather, the content of lab quizzes from
  previous offerings of this course, will be used as regular labs.
* According to the [meeting schedule][schedule], take-home exams will be
  administered. Details to follow.

### Synchronous Q&A sessions
* During our regularly scheduled class times, I will host a live Q&A via
  [Zoom][zoom-class]. See [here][zoom-instructions] for instructions on using Zoom. These sessions will be recorded for future reference (*pending
  my figuring out how to do this*).
* The same is true for lab sessions. During regularly schedule lab sections, I
  will host a live Q&A via [Zoom][zoom-labs].

### Synchronous digital office hours
* I will be available for digital office hours, conducted using whichever mode
  of communication that you prefer / is appropriate for the nature of the
  meeting.
  * To schedule digital office hours, please schedule a meeting with me
    (preferably using Outlook), and indicate the purpose of the meeting and
    which technology would like to use / which you think would be best given the
    nature of the meeting.
